<p>
    (1) Our application uses its own virtual currency, which provides users with
    the opportunity to obtain exclusive benefits. This currency can be acquired
    in two main ways:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        By completing paid courses, where each completed course grants the user
        a specific amount of coins, varying depending on the plan the person has
        contracted.
    </li>
    <li>
        Through the purchase of pricing plans, which grants users a specific
        amount of coins, varying depending on the plan the person has
        contracted.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The conversion rate of our virtual currency is transparent and
    straightforward: 10 coins equal 1 euro. This relationship is maintained in a
    proportional manner, so 100 coins equal 10 euros, and so forth.
</p>
<p>
    (2) On our platform, organization and accessibility are prioritized, so we
    have designed a clear structure for presenting courses. Each category has
    two distinct sections that provide options tailored to various preferences.
    Firstly, we highlight the "Silver Level Courses" section, where users will
    find a wide variety of up to ten courses within the corresponding category.
    These courses provide a solid and comprehensive foundation for those who
    want to thoroughly explore the topic. On the other hand, we offer the "Gold
    Level Courses" section, which features up to five advanced and specialized
    courses in the same category. These courses are designed for users seeking a
    deeper and more detailed approach, providing high-quality content that meets
    the needs of those looking to take their knowledge to the next level.

<h2><a id="_Toc724991496"></a>Monitoring</h2>
<p>
    To perform SLA monitoring, we will use <em>Slack</em>, where application
    users can submit requests or incidents through a form.
</p>
<p>
    We will also utilize <em>Jira</em>, a platform that collects all requests
    and incidents submitted by users. Additionally, it provides information on
    various statistics and allows us to analyze and monitor data, as well as
    keep track of the status of implementation of certain customer requests.
</p>
<h2><a id="_Toc1686168106"></a>Support</h2>
<p>
    User support will be provided from 10:00 AM to 10:00 PM, Monday to Friday,
    and from 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM on Saturdays.
</p>
<h2><a id="_Toc915848500"></a>Compensations</h2>
<p>
    In the event that any of the included services fail to meet the commitment
    of included services, only for the Pro plan, you will be eligible to receive
    a service credit, as described below.
</p>
<p>
    Service credits are calculated as a percentage of the total charges paid by
    you for the included service that experienced unavailability, according to
    the schedule below:
</p>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td><p>Monthly Uptime Percentage</p></td>
        <td><p>Service Credit Percentage</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><p>Less than 99.99%, but equal to or greater than 99.0%</p></td>
        <td><p>10%</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><p>Less than 99.0%, but equal to or greater than 95.0%</p></td>
        <td><p>30%</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><p>Less than 95.0%</p></td>
        <td><p>100%</p></td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>
    In the event that the monthly uptime percentage decreases due to a problem
    related solely and exclusively to the scope of third-party responsibilities,
    no service credits will be offered to the customer.
</p>
<h1><a id="_Toc1517906282"></a>Identification</h1>
<p>
    Each contract will have a unique version number to identify the contract of
    each user. This number will be given by a set of numbers, which follows the
    structure:
</p>
<p><em>Phone-Plan-Date</em></p>
<p>
    Where "Phone" is the customer's associated phone number, "Plan" is the plan
    number (1 indicates Basic plan, 2 Advanced plan, and 3 Pro plan), and "Date"
    is a number in the format "yyyymmdd" indicating the date when the plan was
    last modified.
</p>
